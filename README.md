# Getting Started with Create React App

This is my first TypeScript application in React. In it, you can see meteorology data from:
- Lisbon
- New York
- London
- SÃ£o Paulo.

The data is fetched from the Openweathermap API, and for the first time, I used Axios to make such requests (Before I used Fetch.)

## Technologies used
- React in TypeScript
- Axios
- Cypress

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run cy:open`

It is important that before running the tests, you already have the application running on port 3000.
